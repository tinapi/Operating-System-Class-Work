In this project, I built a Unix-like file system on the ThreadOS. Through the use of the file system, user programs will now be able to access persistent data on disk by way of stream-oriented files 
rather than the more painful direct access to disk blocks with rawread() and rawrite().

The file system should provide user threads with the system calls that will allow them to format, to open, to read from , to write to, to update the seek pointer of, to close, to delete, and to get 
the size of their files.
